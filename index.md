# Welcome to Evan Wang's GitHub Page
Check out some of the projects that I've worked on (and that I'm proud of)!

## Some of my hackathon projects
These are some projects I've collaborated with others on during hackathons. _Fun thing that I learned while at a hackathon, ice cream sandwiches are completely soluble in coffee._
- [**HW**](https://github.com/fuzzyhappy/HW-PHS), a local multiplayer real-time tank game made for HackPHS 2019
- [**Pedestrian Traffic Simulator**](https://github.com/fuzzyhappy/pedestrian-traffic-simulator), a hallway traffic simulator and top 10 finalist at HackHunterdon 2018
- I also worked on a Oculus VR game which won best game at HackPHS 2018, but did not use git to manage it.
- I also worked on an iOS app game at MontyHacks 2017.

## Some personal projects
These are projects that I've worked on in my freetime, sometimes with others, mostly just by myself.
- [**People Die When They Are Shot**](https://github.com/fuzzyhappy/GAMERS-RISE-UP), 2D arena shooter shmup bullet hell hybrid game
- [**Mr. Reyes Bot**](https://github.com/fuzzyhappy/reyes-bot), a Discord bot designed to regulate people who need help from my multivariable calculus teacher
- I also worked on an iOS app game as part of PHS' iLaunch club called Chernaya Dyra in 2016. I don't recommend you download it.

## Misc. attestaments to my programming competency
This sections is for projects I've worked on as assignments in my various programming courses and are more accurate to my professional coding abilities
- [**Percolation_EW**](https://github.com/fuzzyhappy/percolate-this-you), a program that uses a Quick Union algorithm to simulate percolation and determine the average amount of empty squares required for a grid to percolate. Accounts for backwash. Runtime efficiency is N^2 logN.
